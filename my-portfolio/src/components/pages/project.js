Users will be assigned roles, and based on these roles, they'll have specific permissions to access different departments within the portal. Whether a user has a single role or multiple roles, the RBAC system ensures a secure and streamlined experience. This approach allows for granular control, accommodating diverse organizational needs while maintaining simplicity for users. The goal is to create an efficient, user-friendly portal that adapts seamlessly to evolving access requirements.",
